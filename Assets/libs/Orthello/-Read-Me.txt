REGARDING Unity3D 3.5 version update.
 
When Unity introduced version 3.5 in Feb 2012, The prefab system became stricter (better?) but this
lead to strange behaviour in Orthello when the Orthello 'prefab' Objects were dragged from the
project list into the scene's hierarchy. An automatic prefab disconnect was implemented as a solution.
 
This solution will only work when 'new' prefab Orthello objects are dragged into your scene.
Therefore .. When you are opening an existing Orthello project in 3.5, make sure that all your
OTObjects like : OT, sprites, animations, containers etc are not linked to the original prefab.
 
If there are .. you will see the name in a blue color in your scene's hierarchy .. you can disconnect
these blue objects by selecting them one by one, or choosing [Menu][Game Object][Disconnect Prefab Instance]
When the blue color of the name turns into white you will know that the object is no longer linked.

Examples

in  [Project] /Orthello/Examples you will find the 7 base examples
and 3 pro examples


!IMPORTANT!! If would like to run the JS Javascript Examples, take the following steps

 1. Move the [Project] /Orthello/Standard Assets folder to the root : [Project] /
 2. In each specific example you want to run, enable the Javascript code because
    it is commented out now, because other wise it would generate a compile error.
